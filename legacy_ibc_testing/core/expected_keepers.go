TODO: Remove after upgrading to ibc-go v5
legacy_ibc_testing is temporarily copied into the interchain-security repository for the purpose of testing only.
The integration test suites rely on modifications to ibc-go's test framework that cannot be back-ported to the canonical version that ics will rely on.
These files will be deprecated once ICS is able to upgrade to ibc-go v5.
