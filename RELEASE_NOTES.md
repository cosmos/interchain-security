## üöÄ Highlights

<!-- Add any highlights of this release -->

This release introduces the following features:

- Permissionless (as described in [ADR 019](https://cosmos.github.io/interchain-security/adrs/adr-019-permissionless-ics)) enables users to permissionlessly launch opt-in consumer chains. Note that Top N consumer chains will still need to go through governance. 
- Inactive Provider Validators (as described in [ADR 017](https://cosmos.github.io/interchain-security/adrs/adr-017-allowing-inactive-validators)) enables validators from outside the provider's active validator set to validate on consumer chains.
- Removal of Unbonding Pausing (i.e., the provider-side changes of [ADR 018](https://cosmos.github.io/interchain-security/adrs/adr-018-remove-vscmatured)) reduces the complexity of the ICS protocol and removes the dependency between the liveness of undelegation operations on the Cosmos Hub and the liveness of consumer chains.

In addition, it bumps the following dependencies:

- CometBFT to [v0.38.11](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/releases/tag/v0.38.11)
- Cosmos SDK to [v0.50.9](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.50.9)
- IBC-Go to [v8.5.0](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v8.5.0)
