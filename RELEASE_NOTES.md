## üöÄ Highlights

<!-- Add any highlights of this release -->

This release introduces the following noteworthy changes:

- The cryptographic verification of equivocation feature is ported to SDK 0.47. 
  The feature is already running on the Cosmos Hub as part of the [v2.4.0-lsm](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/releases/tag/v2.4.0-lsm) release. 

- It splits out consumer genesis state to reduce shared data between provider and consumer.
  As a result, the consumer CCV genesis state obtained from the provider chain needs to be transformed to be compatible with different versions of consumer chains. For more details, see the [documentation](https://cosmos.github.io/interchain-security/consumer-development/consumer-genesis-transformation).

- A query (`QueryAllPairsValConAddrByConsumerChainID`) is added to get a list of all assigned consumer keys for a given consumer `chainId`. For more details, see the [documentation](https://cosmos.github.io/interchain-security/features/key-assignment).
