# Testing 

To increase confidence in the correctness of the Interchain Security code we consider various testing approaches.

## Unit Tests

Unit tests are useful for simple standalone functionality, and CRUD operations. Unit tests should use golang's standard testing package, and be defined in files formatted as ```<file being tested>_test.go``` in the same directory as the file being tested, following standard conventions.

[Mocked external keepers](testutil/keeper/mocks.go) (implemented with [gomock](https://github.com/golang/mock)) are available for testing code that briefly interacts with external modules, but still only a single function/method relevant to ccv, and a single chain. Ie. do not use mocked external keepers to test the integration of the ccv module with external modules, or integration between consumer and provider.

## Integration Tests

[integration-tests](tests/integration/) utilize the [IBC Testing Package](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/tree/main/testing), and test functionality that is wider in scope than a unit test, but still able to be validated in-memory. Ie. code where advancing blocks would be useful, simulated handshakes, simulated packet relays, etc.

To run integration tests against your own consumer/provider implementations, use [instance_test.go](tests/integration/instance_test.go) as an example. All you'll need to do is make sure your applications implement the necessary interfaces defined in [interfaces.go](testutil/integration/interfaces.go), pattern match [specific_setup.go](testutil/ibc_testing/specific_setup.go), then pass in the appropriate types and parameters to the suite, as is done in `instance_test.go` for the dummy provider/consumer implementations.

## Differential Tests (WIP)

[Differential tests](tests/difference/) is similar to integration tests, but they compare the system state to an expected state generated from a model implementation.

## End-to-End (E2E) Tests 

[E2E tests](tests/e2e/) run true consumer and provider chain binaries within a docker container and are relevant to the highest level of functionality. E2E tests use queries/transactions invoked from CLI to drive and validate the code.

## Running Tests
Tests can be run using `make`:

```bash
# run unit, integration, diff, and E2E tests
make test

# run unit tests
make test-unit

# run integration tests
make test-integration

# run difference tests
make test-difference

# run unit, integration, and difference tests - shortcut for local development
mate test-dev

# run E2E tests
make test-e2e

# run only happy path E2E tests
make test-e2e-short

# equivalent to make test with caching disabled
make test-no-cache
```

Alternatively you can run tests using `go test`:
```bash
# run all unit, integration, and diff tests using go
go test ./...
# run all unit, integration, and diff tests with verbose output
go test -v ./..
# run all unit, integration, and diff tests with coverage stats
go test -coverpkg=./x/... -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
# run a single unit test
go test -run <unit-test-name> path/to/package
# example: run a single unit test
go test -run TestSlashAcks ./x/ccv/provider/keeper
# run a single integration test
go test -run <test-suite-name>/<test-name> ./...
# example: run a single integration test
go test -run TestProviderTestSuite/TestPacketRoundtrip ./...
# run all E2E tests
go run ./tests/e2e/...
# run all E2E tests with a local cosmos sdk
go run ./tests/e2e/... --local-sdk-path "/Users/bob/Documents/cosmos-sdk/"
# run golang native fuzz tests (https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/fuzz)
go test -fuzz=<regex-to-match-test-name>
# run verbose E2E tests
go run ./tests/e2e/... --local-sdk-path "/Users/bob/Documents/cosmos-sdk/" --verbose
```

### Tesing with Gaia as the provider

Integration tests can be run with Gaia as the provider.
By default, the latest tagged release of Gaia is used - this includes release candidates and stabile releases.

```bash
# use gaia as the provider
go run ./tests/integration/... --use-gaia

# use gaia as the provider - use specific tagged release
go run ./tests/integration/... --use-gaia --gaia-tag v9.0.0
```

NOTE: versions < v9.0.0 are not compatible with ICS.

## Linters and Static Analysis

Several analyzers are used on the code including [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/), [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/), [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/) and [gosec](https://github.com/securego/gosec). Some of these are run on github when committing to PRs etc, but some tools are also applicable locally, and are built into golang.

```bash
# gofmt to format and simplify code (https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/gofmt)
gofmt -w -s -e .
# go vet to search for suspicious code (https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/vet)
go vet ./...
```

Some useful tools are included in the repository using [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/hooks.html). pre-commit lets you run developer tools either on every git commit, or manually with `pre-commit run --all-files`. See the [config](.pre-commit-config.yaml) for details. In this repo the hooks are not installed to git, as that can be cumbersome, but it is still possible to benefit from them.

```bash
## Prerequisites

# pre-commit
brew install pre-commit
# goimports (https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports)
go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports@latest
# gocyclo (https://github.com/fzipp/gocyclo)
go install github.com/fzipp/gocyclo/cmd/gocyclo@latest
# go-critic https://github.com/go-critic/go-critic
go install github.com/go-critic/go-critic/cmd/gocritic@latest

## Run the tools

pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Debugging

If using VSCode, see [vscode-go/wiki/debugging](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/debugging) to debug unit tests or go binaries.

More instructions will be added soon, in time for the testnet.
