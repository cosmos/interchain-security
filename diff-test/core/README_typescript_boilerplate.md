## Additional Information

### Why include Volta

[Volta][volta]‚Äôs toolchain always keeps track of where you are, it makes sure the tools you use always respect the settings of the project you‚Äôre working on. This means you don‚Äôt have to worry about changing the state of your installed software when switching between projects. For example, it's [used by engineers at LinkedIn][volta-tomdale] to standardize tools and have reproducible development environments.

I recommend to [install][volta-getting-started] Volta and use it to manage your project's toolchain.

### ES Modules

This template uses native [ESM][esm]. Make sure to read [this][nodejs-esm], and [this][ts47-esm] first.

If your project requires CommonJS, you will have to [convert to ESM][sindresorhus-esm].
