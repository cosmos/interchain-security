# Upgrading Replicated Security

## Unreleased

### Provider

Upgrading a provider from v5.1.x requires state migrations. The following migrators should be added to the upgrade handler of the provider chain:

```go
// InitializeMaxValidatorsForExistingConsumers initializes the max validators
// parameter for existing consumers to the MaxProviderConsensusValidators parameter.
// This is necessary to avoid those consumer chains having an excessive amount of validators.
func InitializeMaxValidatorsForExistingConsumers(ctx sdk.Context, providerKeeper providerkeeper.Keeper) {
	maxVals := providerKeeper.GetParams(ctx).MaxProviderConsensusValidators
	for _, chainID := range providerKeeper.GetAllRegisteredConsumerChainIDs(ctx) {
		providerKeeper.SetValidatorSetCap(ctx, chainID, uint32(maxVals))
	}
}

// InitializeMaxProviderConsensusParam initializes the MaxProviderConsensusValidators parameter.
func InitializeMaxProviderConsensusParam(ctx sdk.Context, providerKeeper providerkeeper.Keeper) {
	params := providerKeeper.GetParams(ctx)
	if params.MaxProviderConsensusValidators == 0 {
		params.MaxProviderConsensusValidators = 180
		providerKeeper.SetParams(ctx, params)
	}
}
```

### Governance Proposals

Legacy proposals are not supported anymore by the current version of the provider. Legacy proposals which are still active (voting period or deposit period) and contain one of the following messages that need to be migrated as described below:
- `ConsumerAdditionProposal` needs to be converted to `MsgConsumerAddition`
- `ConsumerModificationProposal` needs to be converted to `MsgConsumerModification`
- `ConsumerRemovalProposal` needs to be converted to `MsgConsumerRemoval`
- `ChangeRewardDenomsProposal` needs to be converted to `MsgChangeRewardDenoms`

The following shows an example on how to migrate a proposal containing a legacy consumer addition proposal message.
Migration for the other messages aobve follows the same pattern. The resulting migration code has to be added to the upgrade handler of the provider chain.

#### Migrate Legacy Proposal Content

```go

// MigrateLegacyConsumerAddition converts a ConsumerAdditionProposal to a MsgConsumerAdditionProposal
// and returns it as `Any` suitable to replace the legacy message.
// `authority` contains the signer address
func MigrateLegacyConsumerAddition(msg providertypes.ConsumerAdditionProposal, authority string) (*codec.Any, error) {
  sdkMsg := providertypes.MsgConsumerAddition{
		ChainId:                           msg.ChainId,
		InitialHeight:                     msg.InitialHeight,
		GenesisHash:                       msg.GenesisHash,
		BinaryHash:                        msg.BinaryHash,
		SpawnTime:                         msg.SpawnTime,
		UnbondingPeriod:                   msg.UnbondingPeriod,
		CcvTimeoutPeriod:                  msg.CcvTimeoutPeriod,
		TransferTimeoutPeriod:             msg.TransferTimeoutPeriod,
		ConsumerRedistributionFraction:    msg.ConsumerRedistributionFraction,
		BlocksPerDistributionTransmission: msg.BlocksPerDistributionTransmission,
		HistoricalEntries:                 msg.HistoricalEntries,
		DistributionTransmissionChannel:   msg.DistributionTransmissionChannel,
		Top_N:                             msg.Top_N,
		ValidatorsPowerCap:                msg.ValidatorsPowerCap,
		ValidatorSetCap:                   msg.ValidatorSetCap,
		Allowlist:                         msg.Allowlist,
		Denylist:                          msg.Denylist,
		Authority:                         authority,
		MinStake:                          msg.MinStake,
		AllowInactiveVals:                 msg.AllowInactiveVals,
	}
	return codec.NewAnyWithValue(&sdkMsg)
}

func MigrateProposal(proposal proposal govtypes.Proposal) err {
	for idx, msg := range proposal.GetMessages() {
		sdkLegacyMsg, isLegacyProposal := msg.GetCachedValue().(*govtypes.MsgExecLegacyContent)
		if !isLegacyProposal {
			continue
		}
		content, err := govtypes.LegacyContentFromMessage(sdkLegacyMsg)
		if err != nil {
			continue
		}

		msgAdd, ok := content.(*providertypes.ConsumerAdditionProposal)
		if ok {
			anyMsg, err := migrateLegacyConsumerAddition(*msgAdd, govKeeper.GetAuthority())
			if err != nil {
				return err
			}
			proposal.Messages[idx] = anyMsg
		}
	}
	return govKeeper.SetProposal(ctx, proposal)
}
```

## [v5.1.x](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/releases/tag/v5.1.0)

### Provider

***Note that providers using v5.0.0 cannot upgrade to v5.1.0 cleanly***

Providers using versions `v4.0.x`, `v4.1.x`, `v4.2.x`, `v4.3.x` and `v4.4.x` can upgrade to `v5.1.0`.

Upgrading from `v4.x` to `v5.1.0` will upgrade the provider `consensus version` to 7.

Upgrade code will be executed automatically during the upgrade procedure.

### Consumer

Upgrading the consumer from `v5.0.0` to `v5.1.0` will not require state migration.

This guide provides instructions for upgrading to specific versions of Replicated Security.

## [v5.0.0](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/releases/tag/v5.0.0)

### Provider

***Note that providers should not be using this release***

v5.0.0 was a **consumer only release**.

### Consumer

Upgrading the consumer from `v4.x` to `v5.0.0` will require state migrations.

Consumer versions `v4.0.x`, `v4.1.x`, `v4.2.x`, `v4.3.x` and `v4.4.x` can cleanly be upgraded to `v5.0.0`.

Upgrade code will be executed automatically during the upgrade procedure.

## [v4.4.x](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/releases/tag/v4.4.0)

### Provider

***Note that provider chains should not use this version of ICS***

### Consumer

Upgrading the consumer from `v4.0.0` to `v4.4.0` will not require state migration.

This guide provides instructions for upgrading to specific versions of Replicated Security.

## [v4.3.x](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/releases/tag/v4.3.0)

### Provider

Upgrading a provider from `v4.2.0` to `v4.3.0` requires state migrations that will be done automatically via the upgrade module.

### Consumer

***Note that consumer chains should not use this version of ICS***

## [v4.2.x](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/releases/tag/v4.2.0)

### Provider

Upgrading a provider from `v4.1.0` or `v4.1.0-lsm` to `v4.2.0` or `v4.2.0-lsm` requires state migrations, see relevant pull request [here](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/pull/1809)
for the corresponding migrators.

### Consumer

***Note that consumer chains should not use this version of ICS***

## [v4.1.x](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/releases/tag/v4.1.0-rc2) and [v4.1.x-lsm](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/releases/tag/v4.1.0-lsm-rc2)

### Provider

Upgrading a provider from `v4.0.0` to `v4.1.0` or `v4.1.0-lsm` requires state migrations, see relevant pull request [here](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/pull/1762),
as well as the corresponding migrators [here](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/blob/release/v4.1.x/x/ccv/provider/migrations/migrator.go#L38) and [here](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/blob/release/v4.1.x-lsm/x/ccv/provider/migrations/migrator.go#L38).
Apart from running the ICS migrators, the provider chain also needs to initialize the `ConsumerValSet` for all existing consumer chains to ensure correct validator set replication.
To do so, the following code should be added to the upgrade handler of the provider chain:
```go
func InitICSEpochs(ctx sdk.Context, pk providerkeeper.Keeper, sk stakingkeeper.Keeper) error {
	ctx.Logger().Info("Initializing ICS epochs...")

	// get the bonded validators from the staking module
	bondedValidators := sk.GetLastValidators(ctx)

	for _, chain := range pk.GetAllConsumerChains(ctx) {
		chainID := chain.ChainId
		valset := pk.GetConsumerValSet(ctx, chainID)
		if len(valset) > 0 {
			ctx.Logger().Info("consumer chain `%s` already has the valset initialized", chainID)
		} else {
			// init valset for consumer with chainID
			nextValidators := pk.ComputeNextEpochConsumerValSet(ctx, chainID, bondedValidators)
			pk.SetConsumerValSet(ctx, chainID, nextValidators)
		}
	}

	ctx.Logger().Info("Finished initializing ICS epochs")
	return nil
}
```

### Consumer

***Note that consumer chains can upgrade directly from `v4.0.0` to `v4.1.0`.***

## [v4.0.x](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/tree/release/v4.0.x)

`v4.0.x` sets the minimum required version of Go to `1.21`, see https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/blob/release/v4.0.x/go.mod#L3.

### Provider

Upgrading a provider from `v3.3.0` to `v4.0.0` will require state migrations, see https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/blob/release/v4.0.x/x/ccv/provider/migrations/migrator.go#L31.

### Consumer

***Note that consumer chains can upgrade directly from `v3.1.0` to `v4.0.0`.***

Upgrading a consumer from `v3.2.0` to `v4.0.0` will not require state migration, however, upgrading directly from `v3.1.0` to `v4.0.0` will require state migrations, see https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/blob/release/v4.0.x/x/ccv/consumer/keeper/migrations.go#L22.

In addition, the following migration needs to be added to the upgrade handler of the consumer chain:
```golang
func migrateICSOutstandingDowntime(ctx sdk.Context, keepers *upgrades.UpgradeKeepers) error {
	ctx.Logger().Info("Migrating ICS outstanding downtime...")

	downtimes := keepers.ConsumerKeeper.GetAllOutstandingDowntimes(ctx)
	for _, od := range downtimes {
		consAddr, err := sdk.ConsAddressFromBech32(od.ValidatorConsensusAddress)
		if err != nil {
			return err
		}
		keepers.ConsumerKeeper.DeleteOutstandingDowntime(ctx, consAddr)
	}

	ctx.Logger().Info("Finished ICS outstanding downtime")

	return nil
}
```

## [v3.3.x](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/tree/release/v3.2.x)

### Provider

Upgrading the provider from `v2.x.y` to `v3.3.0` will not require state migration.

## [v3.2.x](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/tree/release/v3.2.x)

`v3.2.0` bumps IBC to `v7.3`. As a result, `legacy_ibc_testing` is not longer required and was removed, see https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/pull/1185. This means that when upgrading to `v3.2.0`, any customized tests relying on `legacy_ibc_testing` need to be updated.

### Consumer

Upgrading the consumer from either `v3.0.0` or `v3.1.0` to `v3.2.0` will require state migrations, see https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/blob/release/v3.2.x/x/ccv/consumer/keeper/migration.go#L25.

## [v3.0.x](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/releases/tag/v3.0.0-rc0)

### Upgrading to Cosmos SDK 0.47

The following should be considered as complementary to [Cosmos SDK v0.47 UPGRADING.md](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0-rc2/UPGRADING.md).

#### Protobuf

Protobuf code generation, linting and formatting have been updated to leverage the `ghcr.io/cosmos/proto-builder:0.11.5` docker container. Replicated Security protobuf definitions are now packaged and published to [buf.build/cosmos/interchain-security](https://buf.build/cosmos/interchain-security) via CI workflows. The `third_party/proto` directory has been removed in favour of dependency management using [buf.build](https://docs.buf.build/introduction).

#### App modules

Legacy APIs of the `AppModule` interface have been removed from ccv modules. For example, for

```diff
- // Route implements the AppModule interface
- func (am AppModule) Route() sdk.Route {
-     return sdk.Route{}
- }
-
- // QuerierRoute implements the AppModule interface
- func (AppModule) QuerierRoute() string {
-     return types.QuerierRoute
- }
-
- // LegacyQuerierHandler implements the AppModule interface
- func (am AppModule) LegacyQuerierHandler(*codec.LegacyAmino) sdk.Querier {
-     return nil
- }
-
- // ProposalContents doesn't return any content functions for governance proposals.
- func (AppModule) ProposalContents(_ module.SimulationState) []simtypes.WeightedProposalContent {
-     return nil
- }
```

#### Imports

Imports for ics23 have been updated as the repository have been migrated from confio to cosmos.

```diff
import (
    // ...
-   ics23 "github.com/confio/ics23/go"
+   ics23 "github.com/cosmos/ics23/go"
    // ...
)
```

Imports for gogoproto have been updated.

```diff
import (
    // ...
-   "github.com/gogo/protobuf/proto"
+   "github.com/cosmos/gogoproto/proto"
    // ...
)
```

## [v2.0.x](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/releases/tag/v2.0.0)

### Provider

Upgrading a provider from `v1.1.0-multiden` to `v2.0.0` will require state migrations. See [migration.go](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/blob/v2.0.0/x/ccv/provider/keeper/migration.go).

### Consumer

Upgrading a consumer from `v1.2.0-multiden` to `v2.0.0` will NOT require state migrations.
