## v2.1.0-provider-lsm

Date: September 15th, 2023

* (feature!) [#1280](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/pull/1280) provider proposal for changing reward denoms

## v2.0.0-lsm

Date: August 18th, 2023

* (deps!) [#1120](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/pull/1120) Bump [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) to [v0.45.16-ics-lsm](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/v0.45.16-ics-lsm). This requires adapting ICS to support this SDK release. Changes are state breaking.

## v2.0.0

Date: June 1st, 2023

Unlike prior releases, the ICS `v2.0.0` release will be based on the main branch. `v2.0.0` will contain all the accumulated PRs from the various releases below, along with other PRs that were merged, but not released to production. After `v2.0.0`, we plan to revamp release practices, and how we modularize the repo for consumer/provider.

Upgrading a provider from `v1.1.0-multiden` to `v2.0.0` will require state migrations. See [migration.go](./x/ccv/provider/keeper/migration.go). See the provider module's `ConsensusVersion` in [module](./x/ccv/provider/module.go)

Upgrading a consumer from `v1.2.0-multiden` to `v2.0.0` will NOT require state migrations. See the consumer module's `ConsensusVersion` in [module](./x/ccv/consumer/module.go)

Some PRs from v2.0.0 may reappear from other releases below. This is due to the fact that ICS v1.1.0 deviates from the commit ordering of the main branch, and other releases thereafter are based on v1.1.0.

## v1.2.0-multiden

The first release candidate for a fix built on top of v1.2.0, intended for consumers. This release adds a list of denoms on the consumer that are allowed to be sent to the provider as rewards. This prevents a potential DOS attack that was discovered during the audit of Replicated Security performed by Oak Security and funded by the Cosmos Hub community through Proposal 687. In an effort to move quickly, this release also includes a multisig fix that is effective only for provider. It shouldn't affect the consumer module.

Note PRs were made in a private security repo.

## v1.1.0-multiden

This release combines two fixes on top of v1.1.0, that we judged were urgent to get onto the Cosmos Hub before the launch of the first ICS consumer chain. This is an emergency release intended for providers.

The first fix is to enable the use of multisigs and Ledger devices when assigning keys for consumer chains. The second is to prevent a possible DOS vector involving the reward distribution system.

Note PRs were made in a private security repo.

[full diff](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/compare/v1.1.0...release/v1.1.0-multiden)

### Multisig fix

On April 25th (a week and a half ago), we began receiving reports that validators using multisigs and Ledger devices were getting errors reading Error: unable to resolve type URL /interchain_security.ccv.provider.v1.MsgAssignConsumerKey: tx parse error when attempting to assign consensus keys for consumer chains.

We quickly narrowed the problem down to issues having to do with using the PubKey type directly in the MsgAssignConsumerKey transaction, and Amino (a deprecated serialization library still used in Ledger devices and multisigs) not being able to handle this. We attempted to fix this with the assistance of the Cosmos-SDK team, but after making no headway for a few days, we decided to simply use a JSON representation of the PubKey in the transaction. This is how it is usually represented anyway. We have verified that this fixes the problem.

### Distribution fix

The ICS distribution system works by allowing consumer chains to send rewards to a module address on the provider called the FeePoolAddress. From here they are automatically distributed to all validators and delegators through the distribution system that already exists to distribute staking rewards. The FeePoolAddress is usually blocked so that no tokens can be sent to it, but to enable ICS distribution we had to unblock it.

We recently realized that unblocking the FeePoolAddress could enable an attacker to send a huge number of different denoms into the distribution system. The distribution system would then attempt to distribute them all, leading to out of memory errors. Fixing a similar attack vector that existed in the distribution system before ICS led us to this realization.

To fix this problem, we have re-blocked the FeePoolAddress and created a new address called the ConsumerRewardsPool. Consumer chains now send rewards to this new address. There is also a new transaction type called RegisterConsumerRewardDenom. This transaction allows people to register denoms to be used as rewards from consumer chains. It costs 10 Atoms to run this transaction.The Atoms are transferred to the community pool. Only denoms registered with this command are then transferred to the FeePoolAddress and distributed out to delegators and validators.

## v1.0.0

Date: February 6th, 2023

This is the first version of Interchain Security (ICS), also known as _Replicated Security_ (RS).
Replicated Security is a feature which will allow a chain -- referred to as the _provider_ -- to share security with other chains -- referred to as _consumers_.
This means that the provider's validator set will be granted the right to validate consumer chains.
The communication between the provider and the consumer chains is done through the IBC protocol over a unique, ordered channel (one for each consumer chain). Thus, RS is an IBC application.

### Features / sub-protocols

RS consist of the following core features:

- **Channel Initialization**: Enables the provider to add new consumer chains. This process is governance-gated, i.e., to add a new consumer chain, a `ConsumerAdditionProposal` governance proposal must be sent to the provider and it must receive the necessary votes.
- **Validator Set Update**: Enables the provider to 
  (1) update the consumers on the voting power granted to validators (based on the changes in the active validator set on the provider chain), 
  and (2) ensure the timely completion of unbonding operations (e.g., undelegations).
- **Consumer Initiated Slashing**: Enables the provider to jail validators for downtime infractions on the consumer chains. 
- **Reward Distribution**: Enables the consumers to transfer to the provider (over IBC) a portion of their block rewards as payment for the security provided. Once transferred, these rewards are distributed on the provider using the protocol in the [distribution module of Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.45/modules/distribution/). 
- **Consumer Chain Removal**: Enables the provider to remove a consumer either after a `ConsumerRemovalProposal` passes governance or after one of the timeout periods elapses -- `InitTimeoutPeriod`, `VscTimeoutPeriod`, `IBCTimeoutPeriod`.
- **Social Slashing**: Equivocation offenses (double signing etc.) on consumer chains are logged, and then can be used in a governance proposal to slash the validators responsible.

In addition, RS has the following features:

- **Key Assignment**: Enables validator operators to use different consensus keys for each consumer chain validator node that they operate.
- **Jail Throttling**: Enables the provider to slow down a "worst case scenario" attack where a malicious consumer binary attempts to jail a significant amount (> 2/3) of the voting power, effectively taking control of the provider.
