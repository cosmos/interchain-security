- `[x/provider]` Enable the customization of the slashing and jailing conditions 
  for infractions committed by validators on consumer chains (as per 
  [ADR 020](https://cosmos.github.io/interchain-security/adrs/adr-020-cutomizable_slashing_and_jailing)). 
  Every consumer chain can decide the punishment for every type of infraction.
