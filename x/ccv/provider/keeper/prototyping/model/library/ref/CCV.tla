--------------------------- MODULE CCV ---------------------------
(*
 * Modeling voting power relay between provider- and consumer chains in ICS.
 *
 * Simplifications:
 *   - We only track voting power, not bonded tokens
 *   - CCV channel creation is atomic and never fails/times out.
 *   - No new consumers join midway.
 *   - Block height is not modeled.

EXTENDS Integers, Sequences, Apalache, typedefs

CONSTANT 
  \* The set of all nodes, which may take on a validator role.
  \* node \in Nodes is a validator <=> node \in DOMAIN votingPowerRunning
  \* @type: Set($node);
  Nodes, 
  \* The set of all consumer chains. Consumers may be removed 
  \* during execution, but not added.
  \* @type: Set($chain);
  ConsumerChains, 
  \* Time that needs to elapse, before a received VPC is considered
  \* mature on a chain.
  \* @type: $time;
  UnbondingPeriod,
  \* Time that needs to elapse, before a message is considered to have
  \* timed out (resulting in the removal of the related consumer chain).
  \* @type: $time;
  Timeout,
  \* Maximal time by which clocks are assumed to differ from the provider chain.
  \* Since consumer chains don't communicate, we don't care about 
  \* drift between tow consumers (though it's implicitly less than MaxDrift, if
  \* each differs from the provider chain by at most MaxDrift).
  \* The specification doesn't force clocks to maintain bounded drift, 
  \* but the invariants are only verified in cases where clocks never drift too far.
  \* @type: $time;
  MaxDrift

\* Provider chain only
VARIABLES
  \* Snapshots of the voting power on the provider chain, at the times
  \* when a VPC packet was sent.
  \* t \in DOMAIN votingPowerHist <=> VPC packet sent at time t
  \* @type: $packet -> $votingPowerOnChain;
  votingPowerHist,
  \* Current voting power on the provider chain. 
  \* @type: $votingPowerOnChain;
  votingPowerRunning,
  \* Current status for each consumer. May be one of: 
  \* Unused - Initializing - Active - Dropped
  \* @type: $chain -> STATUS;
  consumerStatus,
  \* Set of chains live at the time a packet was sent (who are expected to reply)
  \* @type: $packet -> Set($chain);
  expectedResponders,
  \* The set of MatureVSCPacket sent by consumer chains to the
  \* provider chain.
  \* @type: Set($matureVSCPacket);
  maturePackets

\* Consumer chains or both
VARIABLES 
  \* Representation of the current voting power, as understood by consumer chains.
  \* Because consumer chains may not arbitrarily modify their own voting power,
  \* but must instead update in accordance to VPC packets received from the
  \* provider, it is sufficient to only track the last received packet.
  \* The voting power on chain c is then equal to votingPowerHist[votingPowerReferences[c]].
  \* @type: $chain -> $time;
  votingPowerReferences,
  \* The queues of VPC packets, waiting to be received by consumer chains.
  \* Note that a packet being placed in the channel is not considered 
  \* received by the consumer, until the receive-action is taken.
  \* @type: $chain -> Seq($packet);
  ccvChannelsPending,
  \* The queues of VPC packets, that have been received by consumer chains in the past.
  \* @type: $chain -> Seq($packet);
  ccvChannelsResolved,
  \* The current times of all chains (including the provider).
  \* @type: $chain -> $time;
  currentTimes,
  \* Bookkeeping of maturity times for received packets.
  \* A consumer may only send a MatureVSCPacket (i.e. notify the provider) after
  \* its local time exceeds the time designated in maturityTimes.
  \* For each consumer chain c, and VSC packet t sent by the provider,
  \* a) t \in DOMAIN maturityTimes[c] <=> c has received packet t 
  \* b) if t \in DOMAIN maturityTimes[c], then maturity for t on c is 
  \*    guarded by currentTimes[c] >= maturityTimes[c][t]
  \* @type: $chain -> $packet -> $time;
  maturityTimes

\* Bookkeeping
VARIABLES 
  \* Name of last action, for debugging
  \* @type: Str;
  lastAction,
  \* VPC flag; Voting power may be considered to have changed, even if 
  \* the (TLA) value of votingPowerRunning does not (for example, due to a sequence
  \* of delegations and un-delegations, with a net 0 change in voting power).
  \* We use this flag to determine whether it is necessary to send a VPC packet.
  \* @type: Bool;
  votingPowerHasChanged,
  \* Invariant flag, TRUE iff clocks never drifted too much
  \* @type: Bool;
  boundedDrift

\* Helper tuples for UNCHANGED syntax
\* We don't track consumerStatus and lastAction in var tuples, because
\* they change each round.
