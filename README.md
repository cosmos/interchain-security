**interchain-security** contains a working and in-production implementation of the Replicated Security protocol (aka Interchain Security V1). Replicated security is an open sourced IBC application which allows cosmos blockchains to lease their proof-of-stake security to one another.

For more details on the Replicated Security protocol, take a look at the [docs](https://cosmos.github.io/interchain-security/) or [technical specification](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/blob/main/spec/app/ics-028-cross-chain-validation/README.md).

## Instructions

**Prerequisites**

```bash
## For OSX or Linux

# go 1.20 (https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/go)
brew install go@1.20
# jq (optional, for testnet) (https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/jq)
brew install jq
# docker (optional, for integration tests, testnet) (https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

```

**Installing and running binaries**

```bash
# install interchain-security-pd and interchain-security-cd binaries
make install
# run provider
interchain-security-pd
# run consumer
interchain-security-cd
# (if the above fail, ensure ~/go/bin on $PATH)
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

Inspect the [Makefile](./Makefile) if curious.

## Testing

See [testing docs](./TESTING.md).
