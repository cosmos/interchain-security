# Roadmap Interchain Security

_Lastest update: June 20th, 2022_

This document endeavors to inform the wider Cosmos community about plans and priorities for the work on Interchain Security (ICS). This roadmap should be read as a high-level guide, rather than a commitment to schedules and deliverables. The degree of specificity is inversely proportional to the timeline. We will update this document periodically to reflect the status and plans.

For more details, take a look at the [ICS project board](https://github.com/orgs/cosmos/projects/25). 
 
## Q2 - 2022

- Finalize core ICS features that enable a provider chain to provide security to multiple consumer chains.
  - https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/issues/35
  - https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/issues/27
  - https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/issues/39
- Create a minimum viable consumer chain (MVCC) that enables testing core ICS features.
  - https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/issues/139
- Create in-memory test driver based on the ibc-go testing framework.
  - https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/pull/126
- Finalize ICS spec
  - https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/issues/670

## Q3 - 2022

- Differential testing of ICS that tests the core ICS features (excluding distribution, channel initialization, consumer chain removal, expired clients).
  - https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/issues/137
- Enable the provider chain to be easily restarted in case it halts.
  - https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/issues/158
  - https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/issues/121
- Test edge cases regarding channel initialization, consumer chain removal, and clients expiring.
- Upgrade to SDK v0.46
  - https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/issues/63
- Integrate with Liquid Staking module
  - https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/issues/67
- Integrate with Cosmos Hub (Gaia)
  - https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/issues/131
- Incentivized testnet 
- External audit
- Integration test
