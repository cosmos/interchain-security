## Â Key Assignment

The key assignment feature enables validators to use different consensus keys for each consumer chain. The provider allows validators to submit an AssignConsumerKey transaction to the provider chain. Pseudocode for type:

```txt

  string chain_id;
  // The validator address on the provider
  string provider_addr;
