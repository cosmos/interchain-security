# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 3](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ npm install
```

### Local Development

```
$ npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

This is not intended for local development but it is used during the deploy sequence.

# Adding versions

To add/remove versions from the page you can modify `versions.json`.

At the time of writing it looked like this:
```json
[
    "v4.0.0",
    "v4.1.0",
    "v5.0.0-rc0"
]
```

You can remove any version that you no longer need and the build process will remove it from the final page.


# Accessing versioned docs locally

```shell
# from interchain-security/docs run:
./sync_versions.sh
```

The script above will create `versioned_docs` and `versioned_sidebars` directories inside `interchain-security/docs`.

To view the docs run:

```shell
cp supported_versions.json versions.json # needed to show the version dropdown
npm run start
```

Remove `versions.json` after use to prevent interference with local documentation.

Remember to check back out to your working branch. Running `./sync_versions.sh` will leave you in a detached head state.
(simply run `git checkout <working-branch>)

## Note:
The script will exit if you have uncommitted changes.
The script switches branches while building the versioned docs - **please note that this could overwrite your local changes**.


# Legacy documentation

`legacy-docs-page` [branch](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/tree/legacy-docs-page) contains documentation for versions `<= v4.0.0`. These versions were built using docusaurus `v2.4.0` which is not compatible with docusaurus `v3.x` used at the time of writing. It was not feasible to port the legacy docs from `v2.4.0` because `v3.x` is not compatible with it and it required changing all release branches and cutting patch releases.

The `./docs/legacy` directory on `legacy-docs-page` was created manually, by modifying `docusaurus.config.js` and `versions.json` on `https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/releases/v3.3.1-lsm` and generating the static pages manually using `npm run build`.

The `./docs/legacy` directory gets included into the rest of the documentation using a simple `cp` command during the deploy process using the [build_deploy.sh](./build_deploy.sh) script. It is **not** included during local builds.


# Scripts and make commands

`build_deploy.sh` script builds the documentation output directory for serving static HTML files. It should be executed on the remote server.

`build_local.sh` will build the documentation locally by running `npm run build`. You can check the built web page by running `npm run serve` after the build command completes.

`sync_versions.sh` will fetch and build all docs versions specified in `supported_versions.json`. It is intended to be executed on the remote server.

`versions.json` must remain empty or be removed from your worktree. Avoid pushing it to GitHub.
* this file specifies which versions will be displayed in the supported versions drop down on the docs page
* instead of using it, the supported versions should live in `supported_versions.json`
* this file should only be populated during deployment and never on your local machine

# Building on remote

Building on remote host is handled by [deploy-docs.yml workflow](.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml).

It executes `./sync_versions.sh` and `./build_deploy.sh` scripts and allows the output of the build proces to be served by github pages.
