# ICS Provider Proposals

Interchain security module introduces 3 new proposal types to the provider.

The proposals are used to propose upcoming interchain security events through governance.

## `ConsumerAdditionProposal`
:::info
If you are preparing a `ConsumerAdditionProposal` you can find more information in the [consumer onboarding checklist](../consumer-development/onboarding.md).
:::

Proposal type used to suggest adding a new consumer chain.

When proposals of this type are passed and the `spawn_time` specified in the proposal is reached, all provider chain validators are expected to run infrastructure (validator nodes) for the proposed consumer chain.

Minimal example:
```js
{
    // Time on the provider chain at which the consumer chain genesis is finalized and all validators
    // will be responsible for starting their consumer chain validator node.
    "spawn_time": "2023-02-28T20:40:00.000000Z",
    "title": "Add consumer chain",
    "description": ".md description of your chain and all other relevant information",
    "chain_id": "newchain-1",
    "initial_height" : {
        "revision_height": 0,
        "revision_number": 1,
    },
    // Unbonding period for the consumer chain.
    // It should be smaller than that of the provider.
    "unbonding_period": 86400000000000,
    // Timeout period for CCV related IBC packets.
    // Packets are considered timed-out after this interval elapses.
    "ccv_timeout_period": 259200000000000,
    "transfer_timeout_period": 1800000000000,
    "consumer_redistribution_fraction": "0.75",
    "blocks_per_distribution_transmission": 1000,
    "historical_entries": 10000,
    "genesis_hash": "d86d756e10118e66e6805e9cc476949da2e750098fcc7634fd0cc77f57a0b2b0",
    "binary_hash": "376cdbd3a222a3d5c730c9637454cd4dd925e2f9e2e0d0f3702fc922928583f1"
    // relevant for chains performing a sovereign to consumer changeover
    // in order to maintain the existing ibc transfer channel
    "distribution_transmission_channel": "channel-123"
}
```
More examples can be found in the replicated security testnet repository [here](https://github.com/cosmos/testnets/blob/master/replicated-security/stopped/baryon-1/proposal-baryon-1.json) and [here](https://github.com/cosmos/testnets/blob/master/replicated-security/stopped/noble-1/start-proposal-noble-1.json).

## `ConsumerRemovalProposal`
Proposal type used to suggest removing an existing consumer chain.

When proposals of this type are passed, the consumer chain in question will be gracefully removed from interchain security and validators will no longer be required to run infrastructure for the specified chain.
After the consumer chain removal, the chain in question will no longer be secured by the provider's validator set.

:::info
The chain in question my continue to produce blocks, but the validator set can no longer be slashed for any infractions committed on that chain.
Additional steps are required to completely offboard a consumer chain, such as re-introducing the staking module and removing the provider's validators from the active set.
More information will be made available in the [Consumer Offboarding Checklist](../consumer-development/offboarding.md).
:::

Minimal example:
```js
{
    // the time on the provider chain at which all validators are responsible to stop their consumer chain validator node
    "stop_time": "2023-03-07T12:40:00.000000Z",
    // the chain-id of the consumer chain to be stopped
    "chain_id": "consumerchain-1",
    "title": "This was a great chain",
    "description": "Here is a .md formatted string specifying removal details"
}
```

## ChangeRewardDenomProposal
:::tip
`ChangeRewardDenomProposal` will only be accepted on the provider chain if at least one of the denomsToAdd or denomsToRemove fields is populated with at least one denom. Also, a denom cannot be repeated in both sets.
:::

Proposal type used to mutate the set of denoms accepted by the provider as rewards.

Minimal example:
```js
{
  "title": "Add untrn as a reward denom",
  "description": "Here is more information about the proposal",
  "denomsToAdd": ["untrn"],
  "denomsToRemove": []
}
```
