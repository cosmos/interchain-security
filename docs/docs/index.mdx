# Cosmos Hub - Interchain Security

Welcome to the official documentation for the Cosmos Hub's Interchain Security - a platform for launching Cosmos-SDK chains.

*The Cosmos Hub is the best place to launch a chain.*

With the recent launch of [Partial Set Security](/features/partial-set-security) (PSS), it's easier than ever to leverage the Cosmos Hub validators, stake, and community for your chain. PSS provides powerful new capabilities for permissionlessly launching your chain and [shaping your validator set](/features/power-shaping).

Here you can find information about Interchain Security, consumer chain development and instructions for validator onboarding.
