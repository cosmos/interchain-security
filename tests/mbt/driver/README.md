This folder contains the driver for the MBT framework.
It is responsible for running traces generated by the model against the actual implementation.

The driver runs the system in-memory, using the ["IBC testing"](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/tree/release/v7.0.x/testing)
library to simulate the network.
